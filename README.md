# Free Public WiFi Distribution in Toronto

## Abstract

Public WiFi is a vital tool for modern society, supporting economic, social, and educational development through free internet access. This study examines the influencing factors of free public WiFi distribution in Toronto using datasets from Open Data Toronto. Specifically, it investigates the relationship between building types, population, median income of each ward in Toronto, and the number of public free WiFi hotspots. Linear regression models are utilized to analyze these correlations and offer insights into the current distribution of public WiFi, including potential benefits and disadvantages. Findings indicate that areas with higher population densities or greater concentrations of public amenities tend to have more public WiFi installations, while median income does not significantly influence public WiFi deployment. Understanding these findings is crucial for policymakers and urban planners to ensure the equitable development of digital public Internet infrastructure.
